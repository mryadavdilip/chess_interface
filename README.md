import 'package:chess_board_widget/chess_board_widget.dart';
import 'package:chess_board_widget/logical_interface/interface.dart';
import 'package:chess_board_widget/models/BoardThemeConfig.dart';
```

## Example

```dart
import 'package:chess_interface/arbiter/arbiter.dart';
import 'package:chess_interface/env.dart';
import 'package:chess_interface/logical_interface/piece.dart';
import 'package:chess_interface/models/board_theme_config.dart';

import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

        ChessBoardWidget(
            game: game,
            // optional
            onMove: (Position from, Position to) {},
            // optional
            playAs: PieceColor.black,

            // false by default
            rotateBoard: true,
            arbiter: Arbiter(
              showDialogs: true,
              context: context,
              onGameOver: (gameOverBy) {
                // todo: handle gameOver
              },

              // optional
              onReachingPromotionRank: (position) async {
                // todo: show pieces to player to promote and must return whether player chose a piece or not, if returns false (i.e, player doesn't choose a piece), default promotion is made to queen.
                return true;
              },

              // callback when either player chose a piece or promoted to default (queen)
              onPromoted: (position, promotedTo) {},
            ),
            // true by default
            spectateInitially: false,
            boardSize: 300,
            config: BoardThemeConfig(
              boardColor: Colors.limeAccent,

              /// To add your own resources, refer to the assets folder structure inside this package. If your resources includes sparate materials for each color, add to path like this: "assets/your_materials_name/black/king.png" (or /white/ for white pieces). and same for all other pieces. If you've simple and fillable png recourses, simply add them in "assets/your_materials_name/bishop.png" path.

            ),

## Configuration

### Theme Customization

Customize the board and pieces using `BoardThemeConfig`. You can define your own colors and piece styles via the asset directory:

```dart
BoardThemeConfig(
  boardColor: Colors.green[700],
  materialVariety: 'modern_minimalist',
);
```

### Piece Rendering

The `ChessPiece` class loads the appropriate asset based on the type, color, and selected material style:

```dart
ChessPiece(type: PieceType.queen, color: PieceColor.black)
  .getResource('classic');
```

### Move Validation

```dart
bool isValid = MoveValidator.isValidMove(ChessBoardInterface game, Position from, Position to);
```

It supports:

- All standard chess moves
- Pawn special rules
- Castling logic (including history tracking)
- En passant and double pawn pushes
